\# Centralized E-Commerce Platform for Laptop Sales \& Auction Management  

\### Group 8 – Project README



\## 📌 Overview  

This project is a \*\*centralized web-based e-commerce platform\*\* designed to streamline the buying, selling, and auctioning of laptops and related computer peripherals. The system brings together \*\*customers\*\*, \*\*sellers\*\*, and an \*\*admin team\*\* into a single unified platform where users can browse products, compare options, place orders, and participate in auctions.



The platform supports multiple vendors, enabling both individuals and organizations to sell their products while ensuring customers have access to a wide variety of laptops and accessories. In addition to standard e-commerce features, an \*\*integrated auction system\*\* allows sellers to list special or limited-edition items for bidding.



This repository will serve as the workspace for documentation and future development.
